# EVM-Lite Dashboard

Note: this is a WIP and is lacking functionality

A graphical dashboard to display the status of a network of evm-lite nodes

Note: It is currently hard coded to query the nodes on the testnet

## Installation

To run the dashboard clone the repo and run a python HTTP server:

```console
git clone https://github.com/mosaicnetworks/evm-lite-dashboard.git
cd evm-lite-dashboard
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
